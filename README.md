# And-Wolf-stay-off-the-dance-floor

A Python application based on the Konata Dancer app created by chaosmaster4, this time around Wolf from the PAYDAY game series will keep you company and make your day better with his silly and sensual dance moves! 
His dirty dancing will stay on top of any other currently open program just so you can revel in that sweet eye candy.

At it's current state the app is pretty basic since it was created mostly as a joke but I might come back and add more features in the future (no promises!)

The keybinds go as following:

- Press "Q" in order to stop playing music
- Press "R" to resume the song
- Press "ESC" to close the application

It's not really an intended feature but it is also possible to add in on your own song by replacing the .wav file with your own, just to be sure to keep the exact same name (It only works with .wav files!!! no mp3s!!!) 

Credits for the dancing animation go to -> https://pyonicpyro.tumblr.com/post/752002822566985728/caramelldansen-time
I do not own the character nor the music, all credits go to their respective creators as this is merely a fun fan project.

Have fun with our favorite unhinged swedish boy! ;)
